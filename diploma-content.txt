ABSTRACT

    The "Hearth & Home" project is a browser-based ecommerce prototype that showcases curated home goods across kitchen, bath, living, and outdoor categories. A lightweight Express server (server.js) handles compression and static file delivery, falling back to `index.html` for deep links while serving pre-rendered pages like `kitchen.html` and `living.html`. The front end uses ES modules (`assets/app.js` and `assets/data.js`) to hydrate static HTML templates with structured data: product cards, category capsules, testimonials, and gallery images all derive from JSON-like collections rather than hardcoded markup.
    Client interactions run entirely on the client: state for filters, search, view toggles, cart contents, and favorites lives in memory and persists to localStorage keys (`hearth_home_cart`, `hearth_home_favorites`). Reusable DOM templates enable product detail modals, cart drawers, and favorites grids to share styling and behavior across pages. Accessibility and responsiveness are addressed through semantic HTML, ARIA-aware controls, and a CSS token system in `assets/styles.css` that keeps typography, spacing, and color palettes consistent.
    This diploma-ready prototype demonstrates how a static-first architecture, enhanced with client-side JavaScript, can deliver a convincing retail experience without a full backend. It covers the complete flow from discovery (category filtering, search, spotlights) to consideration (detailed product dialogs, highlights, reviews) and intent (cart, tax calculation, checkout form). The result is a maintainable, data-driven storefront suitable for presentations on modern web commerce design and implementation.
